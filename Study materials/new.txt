The School Bus Students Tracking System is an intelligent, technology-enabled system 
focusing on the safety, efficiency, and communication aspects of the school transportation 
system. It will employ technologies including GPS, QR code attendance, notification, and 
route planning to make it easier for the parents, drivers, and school officers to coordinate 
efficiently. 
1. Real-Time Bus Tracking: 
• Mutual connection of the GPS to obtain the required data regarding the exact location 
of the school bus in real time. 
• An ETA alert is sent to the parents allowing the latter to track the shuttles and 
decrease the time spent waiting for the shuttles. 
2. QR Code-Based Attendance System: 
• Regarding the identification code of each student, a small QR code integrated into 
the ID card is assigned to a learner. 
• The system comprises the use of a scanner that is placed on the bus and the student 
scans their unique code as they get on or get out of the bus. Hence giving the system 
real-time information. 
3. Push Notifications: 
• Whenever the bus is approaching any parent's stop or if the child has boarded or even 
alighted from the bus, parents are alerted. 
• Such notifications include route changes, delayed arrival of a passenger's preferred 
bus, or an emergency. 
4. Optimized Route for Drivers: 
• Automated routing for school bus deployment making use of artificial intelligence 
mapped against real-time traffic updates. 
• Pick and drop locations of students' and parents' responses on attendance. 
• Facilitates fuel consumption and reduces transport times 
5. Centralized Management System: 
• App in school authorities, where one can view the whereabouts of the bus, student 
students, and the routes in general. 
• This further creates an enabler for efficient decision-making & management of the 
emergency response. 
6. Enhanced Security Features: 
• Encrypted data and a safe server make student and location info safe & secure. 
• Basic biometric identification (for example with fingerprints, or a facial scan) – This 
seems optional in the configuration, overlaying multiple layers of student 
identification.

7. Cross-Platform Compatibility: 
• Mobile application – this is an Android and iOS-based application to make the 
application easily accessible by parents, drivers, and school administrators. 
Advantages of the Proposed Solution: 
• For Parents: Assists in the reduction of uncertainty and brings assurance that their 
child is safe plus the location of the bus. 
• For Drivers: It makes it easier to avoid making many unduly stops that may be 
between two effective destinations. 
• For School Management: Coordination and optimization of resource sharing and 
current state monitoring of transportation management. 
Integrating mobile applications and GPS navigation into the function of a user-friendly 
design should provide contemporary improvement to the safety, performance, and 
dependability of school transportation systems, as well as establish a new standard for 
intelligent student tracking.
