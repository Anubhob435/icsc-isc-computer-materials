Laws of Boolean Algebra
-----------------------

Boolean algebra is a mathematical system used to describe logical operations.
It works with binary values: 0 (false) and 1 (true).

Applications:
-------------
These laws are essential for simplifying Boolean expressions, designing
efficient digital circuits, and minimizing logic gates in hardware systems.


Laws and Identities:
--------------------

1. Identity Laws:
   A + 0 = A
   A · 1 = A

2. Null Laws:
   A + 1 = 1
   A · 0 = 0

3. Idempotent Laws:
   A + A = A
   A · A = A

4. Domination Laws:
   A + ¯A = 1
   A · ¯A = 0

5. Double Negation Law:
   ¯(¯A) = A

6. Commutative Laws:
   A + B = B + A
   A · B = B · A

7. Associative Laws:
   (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)
   (A · B) · C = A · (B · C)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

8. Distributive Laws:
   A · (B + C) = A · B + A · C
   A + (B · C) = (A + B) · (A + C)

9. Absorption Laws:
   A + A · B = A
   A · (A + B) = A

10. De Morgan’s Laws:
    ¯(A · B) = ¯A + ¯B
    ¯(A + B) = ¯A · ¯B
