1. What will be the data type of the expression 'a' + 5?

2. What will be stored in the double variable d after this assignment: d = 10 / 3;

3. What is the output of 5 % 3?

4. What is the output of -3 * 2 + 1?


5. What will be printed if the user enters 7 in the following code:

int x = 5;
if (x < 6) {
  System.out.println("Small");
} else {
  System.out.println("Large");
}


6. What will be printed if the user enters 9 in the following code:

if (a > b) {
  System.out.println("a is bigger");
} else
 
if (a == b) {
  System.out.println("a and b are equal");
} else {
  System.out.println("b is bigger");
}


7. How many times will the following loop execute: 

for (int i = 10; i > 0; i--) 
	{
	System.out.print(0);
	}


8. What will be the final value of n after this loop finishes: 

for (int n = 5; n < 15; n += 2) 
	{ 
	System.out.print(1);	
	}
