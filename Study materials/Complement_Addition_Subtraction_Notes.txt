### Short Note: Addition and Subtraction using 1â€™s and 2â€™s Complement

---

âœ… 1â€™s Complement

- 1â€™s Complement: Invert all bits (0 â†’ 1, 1 â†’ 0)
  - Example: Binary of +5 = 0101 â†’ 1â€™s complement = 1010 (represents -5)

Subtraction using 1â€™s Complement:
1. Take 1â€™s complement of the number to subtract (i.e., negative number).
2. Add it to the other number.
3. If carry occurs, add it to the result (end-around carry).
4. If no carry, result is negative â†’ take 1â€™s complement again.

âœ… 2â€™s Complement

- 2â€™s Complement: Invert all bits + add 1
  - Example: Binary of +5 = 0101 â†’ Invert = 1010 â†’ Add 1 = 1011 (represents -5)

Subtraction using 2â€™s Complement:
1. Take 2â€™s complement of the number to subtract.
2. Add it to the other number.
3. Ignore carry (if it occurs).
4. Result is in proper binary form.

ðŸ§  Key Tips
- Use n bits (like 4-bit, 8-bit) for consistency
- 2â€™s complement is easier for computers â†’ no end-around carry
- Always check sign bit (leftmost bit):
  - 0 = positive, 1 = negative
